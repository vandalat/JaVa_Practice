/*
Given a string s representing a phone number, which we would like to reformat. String S consists of N characters: digits, spaces, and/or dashes. It contains at least two digits. Spaces and dashes in string S can be ignored.

Reformat the given phone number in a way that the digits are grouped in blocks of length three, separated by single dashes. If necessary, the final block or the last two blocks can be of length two.

For example, given string S = "00-44 48 555 8361" we would like to format it as "004-448-555-583-61
