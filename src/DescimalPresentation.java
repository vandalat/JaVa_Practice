/*
Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one &#39;5&#39; digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.

Examples:

1. Given N = 268, the function should return 5268.

2. Given N = 670, the function should return 6750.

3. Given N = 0, the function should return 50.

4. Given N = -999, the function should return -5999.

Assume that: â€¢ Nis an integer within the range [-8,000..8,000).

in your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessmen
